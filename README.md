# Chalet üèòÔ∏è

Welcome to Chalet! Chalet provides a streamlined way to set up and manage development environments
using Docker containers. With Chalet, you can run all your development tools, languages, and applications
in isolated containers, eliminating the need to install any languages or tools directly on your local machine.

* **Language Agnostic**: Supports a wide range of programming languages including Python, Node.js, Ruby, Java, and more.
* **Isolated Environments**: Each project runs in its own container, ensuring clean and conflict-free development setups.
* **Easy Setup** : Spin up development environments with a single command.
* **Consistent Environments**: Ensure all team members are using the same development setup, reducing "it works on my machine" issues.
* **Portable**: Easily share your development environment configurations with others.
